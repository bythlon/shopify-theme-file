After falling during a triathlon because he couldn't unclip during a turn, he decided to develop a bike pedal that provides safety without losing out on performance.Since then, we've spent two years building the technology that allowed us to create Bythlon. Cycling with cleats shows just how the power transfers from your body to your bike. But, an expected stop, a steel hill, or bump in the road makes you regret putting the cleats on and getting chained to your bike in the first place.Bythlon is for the daily commuter, triathlete, beginner rider, and elite cyclist alike. We hope to bring you the experience of professional race pedal set in a way that prioritizes your safety and maximizes your efficiency.<\/p>","text_style":"body"}},"06560d51-3707-4763-8d3b-2eaa4e07bc61":{"type":"icon_button","settings":{"button_link":"#"}}},"block_order":["template--16125312204965__6b4d08ab-915d-49dc-8174-f8733198f56f-heading-1","template--16125312204965__6b4d08ab-915d-49dc-8174-f8733198f56f-text-1","06560d51-3707-4763-8d3b-2eaa4e07bc61"],"custom_css":[".image-with-text__text {font-size: 2.4rem; font-weight: 500; line-height: 39px; text-transform: uppercase;}","@media screen and (min-width: 750px) {.image-with-text__content {padding: 6rem 2rem 7rem 0; } .image-with-text__heading {font-size: 105.74px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 101px; } .image-with-text__text {max-width: 76%; }}","@media screen and (max-width: 750px) {.image-with-text__media-item {order: 1; } .image-with-text {padding-top: 3rem; } .inline-richtext {font-size: calc(var(--font-heading-scale) * 4.2rem); margin-bottom: 1.8rem; }}"],"settings":{"hide_image":true,"height":"small","desktop_image_width":"medium","layout":"text_first","use_custom_width":true,"media_grid_width":35,"text_grid_width":60,"desktop_content_position":"top","desktop_content_alignment":"left","content_layout":"no-overlap","color_scheme":"scheme-4bab409f-848a-447f-aa42-f3ce1f1a73e4","image_behavior":"none","mobile_content_alignment":"left","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"padding_top_mobile":80,"padding_bottom_mobile":36}},"dd008cdf-b87f-4782-a6cf-ae7179bf3963":{"type":"multicolumn","blocks":{"template--16125312204965__dd008cdf-b87f-4782-a6cf-ae7179bf3963-column-1":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Frame_283_f61f1079-bb05-4594-95d2-8d443c01d1d5.png","title":"<strong>Martin Feuerhahn<\/strong>","text":"<p>Martin has over 25 years of experience in the international hardware industry, corporate management, and co-founded several successful startups.
